\title{Specify a loess fit in a GAM formula}
\description{A symbolic wrapper to indicate a smooth term in a formala
 argument to gam}
\usage{
lo(\dots, span=0.5, degree=1)
gam.lo(x, y, w, span, degree, ncols, xeval)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{
the unspecified \code{\dots}  can be a comma-separated list of numeric vectors, numeric matrix, or expressions that evaluate to either of these. If it is a list of vectors, they must all have the same length.}
\item{span}{
the number of observations in a neighborhood. This is the smoothing
parameter for a \code{loess} fit. If specified, the full argument name
\code{span} must be written.}
\item{degree}{the degree of local polynomial to be fit; currently
  restricted to be \code{1} or \code{2}. If specified, the full argument name
\code{degree} must be written.}
\item{x}{for \code{gam.lo}, the appropriate basis of polynomials
  generated from the arguments to \code{lo}. These are also the
  variables that receive linear coefficients in the GAM fit.}
\item{y}{a response variable passed to \code{gam.lo} during backfitting}
\item{w}{weights}
\item{ncols}{for \code{gam.lo} the number of columns in \code{x} used as
  the smoothing inputs to local regression. For example, if
  \code{degree=2}, then \code{x} has two columns defining a degree-2
  polynomial basis. Both are needed for the parameteric part of the fit,
  but \code{ncol=1} telling the local regression routine that the first
  column is the actually smoothing variable.}
\item{xeval}{If this argument is present, then \code{gam.lo} produces a
  prediction at \code{xeval}.}
}
\value{
\code{lo} returns a numeric matrix.  The simplest case is when there is a
single argument to \code{lo} and \code{degree=1}; a one-column matrix is
returned, consisting of a normalized version of the vector.  If
\code{degree=2} in this case, a two-column matrix is returned, consisting
of a degree-2 polynomial basis.  Similarly, if there are
two arguments, or the single argument is a two-column matrix, either a
two-column matrix is returned if \code{degree=1}, or a five-column matrix
consisting of powers and products up to degree \code{2}.  Any dimensional
argument is allowed, but typically one or two vectors are used in
practice.

The matrix is endowed with a number of attributes; the matrix itself is
used in the construction of the model matrix, while the attributes are
needed for the backfitting algorithms \code{general.wam} (weighted additive
model) or \code{lo.wam} (currently not implemented). Local-linear curve
or surface fits reproduce linear responses, while local-quadratic fits
reproduce quadratic curves or surfaces. These parts of the \code{loess}
fit are computed exactly together with the other parametric linear parts

When two or more smoothing variables are given, the user should make
sure they are in a commensurable scale; \code{lo()} does no
normalization. This can make a difference, since \code{lo()} uses a
spherical (isotropic) neighborhood  when establishing the nearest neighbors.


Note that \code{lo} itself does no smoothing; it simply sets things up
for \code{gam}; \code{gam.lo} does the actual smoothing.
of the model.

One important attribute is named \code{call}. For example, \code{lo(x)}
has a call component
\code{gam.lo(data[["lo(x)"]], z, w, span = 0.5, degree = 1, ncols = 1)}.
This is an expression that gets evaluated repeatedly in \code{general.wam}
(the backfitting algorithm).

\code{gam.lo} returns an object with components
\item{residuals}{The residuals from the smooth fit. Note that the
  smoother removes the parametric part of the fit (using a linear fit
  with the columns in \code{x}), so these residual represent the
  nonlinear part of the fit.}
\item{nl.df}{the nonlinear degrees of freedom}
\item{var}{the pointwise variance for the nonlinear fit}

When \code{gam.lo} is evaluated with an \code{xeval} argument, it returns a
matrix of predictions.
}
\details{
  A smoother in gam separates out the parametric part of the fit
  from the non-parametric part. For local regression, the parametric
  part of the fit is specified by the particular polynomial being fit
  locally. The workhorse function \code{gam.lo} fits the local
  polynomial, then strips off this parametric part. All the parametric
  pieces from all the terms in the additive model are fit
  simultaneously in one operation for each loop of the backfitting
  algorithm.
